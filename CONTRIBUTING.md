# Contributing to GlobaLeaks
Like many open source projects, GlobaLeaks benefits from the volunteer effort of the community. 
With the help of volunteers like you the software, its localization, and its documentation all improve. 
We'd love it if you contributed to GlobaLeaks and help make it even better than it is today!

You can contribute to GlobaLeaks in many different (and greatly appreciated) ways:

## Contribute to the software with your development skills!
To learn how to take part in the development of GlobaLeaks read our [software development guidelines](https://github.com/globaleaks/GlobaLeaks/wiki#software-development).

## Translate the software into your language!
GlobaLeaks is currently localized and internationalized in [more than 20 languages](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/globaleaks/).

The work on translation is performed in collaboration with the [Localization Lab](http://www.localizationlab.org) and with help of the [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/globaleaks/) volunteer community.

To read more about how translation is performed and how you can help read the [Localization Lab guide](http://www.localizationlab.org/community).

## Report security flaws and partcipate in our Bug Bounty Program!
Anonymous whistleblowing can be safe and easy.

Unfortunately, no technology is perfect and GlobaLeaks believes that working with skilled security researchers across the globe is crucial in identifying software weaknesses.

While we do our best to provide a secure software by default, security vulnerabilities and new attack techniques are always being discovered. If you believe you've found a security issue in the Globaleaks framework codebase, we encourage you to participate in the [GlobaLeaks bug bounty program](https://hackerone.com/globaleaks) hosted by [Hackerone](https://hackerone.com/globaleaks).
